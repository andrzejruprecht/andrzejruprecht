          <h3>Andrzej Lech Ruprecht, Ph.D. is a doctor of biological sciences, osteologist, and long-time scientist at the <a href="https://ibs.bialowieza.pl/en/" target="_blank">Mammal Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences</a> (MRI-PAS) in Białowieża.
<br />Dr. Ruprecht was born on April 20, 1935, in Gdańsk to Karol and Zofia (née Matecka) Ruprecht. The family moved to Łódź shortly after the German occupation began and then to Nowy Sącz, where Dr. Ruprecht began his primary school education. During primary school, Dr. Ruprecht began collecting skeletal specimens, which would later be added to the MRI-PAS collection. After the liberation, the Ruprecht family returned to Gdańsk. After graduating from the Ogólnokształcące high school in 1955, Dr. Ruprecht began his studies at the local medical academy. After being diagnosed with polio, Dr. Ruprecht decided to discontinue his education at the medical academy. In 1957, he changed his field of study to biology and earth science and began his studies at the <a href="https://amu.edu.pl/en" target="_blank">University of Poznań</a>. He moved to the <a href="https://www.umk.pl/en/" target="_blank">University of Toruń</a> two years later to continue his studies. He graduated in 1962 with a master's degree. The subject of his master's thesis was the diet of a barn owl from the Aleksandrów Kujawski, Ciechocinek, and Raciążek regions. Dr. Ruprecht received his doctorate degree in biological sciences in 1973 from the <a href="https://www.umcs.pl/en/" target="_blank">University of Lublin</a>. His dissertation was titled "Craniometric variability of the Central European muskrat population <i>Ondatra zibethicus</i> (Linnaeus 1766)."
<br />Dr. Ruprecht first visited Białowieża on July 1, 1960, when he arrived for an internship at MRI-PAS after his third year in Toruń. He officially joined MRI-PAS in 1964. He first worked as an assistant and later as a curator. During his career at MRI-PAS, he managed and grew one of the largest skeletal bone collections in Europe. Dr. Ruprecht’s main interests included morphology, systematics, the fauna of mammals, and assessment of taxonomic features that are helpful in identifying osteological materials. His research on owl spitting materials and domestic and foreign collections lead him to work with professor <a href="http://www.isez.pan.krakow.pl/en/emeriti/kkowalski.html" target="_blank">Kazimierz Kowalski</a> on "The key to identify mammals of Poland" (edited by Zdzisław Pucek) and "The distribution of mammals in Poland" (edited by Zdzisław Pucek and Jan Raczyński). In addition, Dr. Ruprecht wrote about and discovered 21 species of bats and four rodents. He also co-authored a hundred-page paper with Dr. <a href="https://miiz.waw.pl/pl/struktura/struktura-miiz?layout=edit&id=592" target="_blank">Wiesław Bogdanowicz</a> about Polish bat fauna and another paper with Andrzej Szwagrzak titled "Distribution of Polish Strigiform owls.” In the book “Endangered and extinct animals," he wrote two chapters on the European mink and woolly owl.
<br />While working in Białowieża, Dr. Ruprecht became more interested in the quaternary mammal species that lived in Poland during the Pleistocene. Inspired by the "Catalog of Pleistocene Polish mammals" by professor Kowalski, he began to see the potential for ​​future research in the Białystok region. He inspected the area by car, negotiated contacts with regional museums and private collectors, and published articles, popularizing his research in the local press. These methods proved to be extremely effective and he soon began receiving the first specimens of aurochs, bison, and bears. At the same time, he also established contacts with paleontologists and teriologists, specialists in fossilized mammal species. He used his free time to visit other departments of PAS and universities in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev to recieve more bone material of fossilized mammals. He slowly became more interested in issues of morphological variability and zoogeography of quaternary mammals, which lead to his first scientific publications on the Białystok region. Among them were reports of a steppe elephant, forest elephant, cave lion, and mammoths, which were the most popular species among the fossilized elephant species in the Białystok region. One of the most surprising findings was the discovery of three mammoth bone specimens in the Białowieża Forest. After 25 years of research, Dr. Ruprecht discovered 10 new species of fossilized mammals in the Białystok region. With the help of <a href="http://www.encyklopedia.puszcza-bialowieska.eu/index.php?dzial=haslo&id=354" target="_blank">Tadeusz Buchalczyk</a>, he also discovered a new species of fauna in Poland, the steppe coward.
<br />In 1990, Dr. Ruprecht went on a disability pension and later moved to Ciechocinek with his wife Joanna. Despite serious health problems, Dr. Ruprecht continued to conduct and publish research with other scientists. He was also involved in conservation efforts of bats, especially in the Kujawy region, and popularized teriological knowledge in the region. Dr. Ruprecht is the author of over 200 publications, including over 70 publications about bats.
<br />Dr. Ruprecht was awarded the Gold Cross of Merit (May 31, 1989) and the Medal of the 40th Anniversary of the People's Poland (July 22, 1984). He also received the Award of the Scientific Secretary of the Polish Academy of Sciences for his co-authorship in the "Distribution of mammals in Poland" (1984). In addition, the Friends Society of Ciechocinek awarded him the medal of professor Leonard Lorentowicz "for outstanding services to the Ciechocinek Spa" (November 10, 1999). He was an honorary member of the Polish Zoological Society and the Polish Society for the Protection of Bats.
<br />Dr. Ruprecht died on July 2, 2010, in Bydgoszcz and was buried on July 10, 2010, at the Municipal Cemetery in Włocławek. He is survived by his children, Dr. Zofia Ruprecht and Dr. Lech Ruprecht, and grandchildren, Victoria and <a href="http://michalruprecht.com" target="_blank">Michał</a> Ruprecht.</h3>
