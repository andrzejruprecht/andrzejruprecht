          <br>Warsaw, Poland—The <a href="https://miiz.waw.pl/en/" target="_blank">Museum and Institute of Zoology of the Polish Academy of Sciences</a> proudly announces the release of Volume 67, Issue 1 of <i>Fragmenta Faunistica</i>. This special issue, edited by Grzegorz Lesiński, is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Andrzej Lech Ruprecht (1935–2010), a distinguished zoologist who profoundly influenced the study of mammal communities through the analysis of owl pellets.

<br><br>Titled <em>“Composition of the Diet of Owls as a Source of Information on the Structure of Local Mammal Communities in Poland,”</em> this issue highlights innovative methods in faunology and features original studies that use owl diets to examine mammalian biodiversity and ecological dynamics.

<br><br>Dr. Ruprecht's contributions to zoology, particularly his mentorship of generations of researchers and his expertise in cranial morphology, are celebrated in this tribute issue. His work continues to shape the study of faunal dynamics and biodiversity in Poland and beyond.

<br><br><b><big>About <i>Fragmenta Faunistica</i></big></b>
<br><i>Fragmenta Faunistica</i>, established in 1930, is an international, peer-reviewed, open-access journal published semiannually by the Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS. The journal focuses on faunology, including the differentiation, distribution, and transformations of fauna, with a particular emphasis on related sciences such as zoogeography, zoocoenology, and taxonomy. Indexed in key databases such as Biological Abstracts, Zoological Record, and Google Scholar, the journal is widely recognized for its contributions to zoological research.

<br><br>The special issue is now available online <a href="https://andrzejruprecht.github.io/pages/press/assets/Fragmenta%20Faunistica%20Publishes%20Special%20Issue%20Honoring%20Dr.%20Andrzej%20Lech%20Ruprecht.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> or via the <a href="https://rcin.org.pl/miiz/dlibra/publication/279989/edition/243024" target="_blank">Digital Repository of Scientific Institutes</a>.
